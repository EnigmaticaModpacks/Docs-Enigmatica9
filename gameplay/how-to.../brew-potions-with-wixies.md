# Brew Potions with Wixies

Wixies are an excellent way to brew potions as they allow skipping a few key steps. Namely, they do not require Water or Blaze Powder, nor do they need Glass Bottles.

## Basic Brewing

We'll need a few items to get started.&#x20;

* 1x Wixie Charm
* 1x Cauldron
* 1x Source Jar with Source
* 3x Arcane Pedestals or Arcane Platforms
* 3x Potion Jars
* 1x Dominion Wand

Place the Cauldron and right-click it with the Wixie Charm. Note, this is a vanilla Minecraft cauldron. right-clicking it with the Wixie Charm will transform it into a Wixie Cauldron. Next place the Source Jar nearby. If it is close enough, the Wixie's Cauldron will fill up with Source.

Now that the Wixie has been placed, she'll need to know what she's crafting. Bear in mind that Wixies can also be used to craft normal crafting table recipes, but our focus here is potions. To tell her what potions to craft, regular potion bottles need to be placed on Arcane Pedestals or Platforms in the spaces adjacent to her Cauldron. She'll need one potion for each step.

For this example, we'll craft a Potion of Spell Damage II. This means we'll need to provide her with an Awkward Potion, a Potion of Spell Damage, and a Potion of Spell Damage II, one on each pedestal.&#x20;

These potions will need to be obtained elsewhere, such as brewing them manually with the vanilla Brewing Stand.&#x20;

Next up, she'll need items to craft with. For this recipe, we'll need Abjuration Essence, Magebloom, and Glowstone. These can be provided in any nearby inventory, so feel free to choose something that fits your particular design style.&#x20;

Lastly, she'll need someplace to put the brewed potions. The Wixie will automatically store them in nearby Potion Jars. She will need one jar per potion step. To avoid issues, it is best to lock these once they have some potion in them.&#x20;

It is therefore recommended that you place the Jars one at a time, allow her to brew that step, then immediately lock it. Locking is done by Sneak Right-Clicking a Potion Jar with a Dominion Wand.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Having trouble getting the right potion in the right jar? Apply a Redstone signal to the Wixie Cauldron to get her to stop. Then right click potions into the Potion Jar manually before locking them.
{% endhint %}

With all the Potion Jars setup and locked, the Wixie will cycle through each potion, brewing one at a time until the Jars are full.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
A single wixie can craft as many different potions as can fit around her cauldron. Theoretically, this would mean up to 26 different potion steps as they can be bothabove and below.
